/// This crate provides an alternative approach to the time crate of the stardard library.
/// It relies on the tsc registers to get the current time instant in a faster and more accurate
/// fasihon.
///
/// Note that this library does has the following limitations:
///
/// 1. It only works on 32/64 bits Linux systems with stable tsc (see this blog post for more information
/// about stable tsc: http://oliveryang.net/2015/09/pitfalls-of-TSC-usage/).
///
/// 2. When this crate is loaded, it will check whether the system has stable tsc.
/// If it does not detect tsc, it will report `false` through the `tsc_stable()` method.
/// Any usage of this crate is strictly forbidended without stable tsc, as the APIs of this
/// crate may report errorneous time result.
///
/// 3. When initializing this library, it may cause a panic if it fails to read the sysfs file or
/// parse the file read result.
///
/// Some of the code is taken from minstant library, but remove some unncessary
/// code path for performance.
